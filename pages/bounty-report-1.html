        <p>Uh, hi, yes, I'm here to make a report to the Bounty Manager?</p>
        <p>So uh, my partner and I went into the Crystal Caverns to find treasure.</p>
        <p>We'd seen the article in South Elysium Times about opportunities there for bounty hunters and we decided to try our luck <br>a-a-and oh gods, we never should have gone! </p>
        <p>I thought there'd only be your average little cave slimes, not those... those things!</p>
        <p>I've never seen a corruption beast up close and personal and I tell ya, it'll be a day too soon if I never see another in my whole life!</p>
